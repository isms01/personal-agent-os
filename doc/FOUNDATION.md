## 🎨 Core Design Values

### 1. Pragmatic First
Prioritize practical utility over perfection.
Build what works, build what's usable.

### 2. Learn By Building
Understanding comes from building and testing,
not from endless planning.

### 3. Explainability
Always be able to explain how and why the system works.
No black boxes.
